# AidBox

## Introduction

A friend of mine took part in a contest with his school and created **Aidbox**. He managed to get the 2nd place and, later asked me to build a website to showcase his "Aid.Box" project. The website
is only showcasing a concept, the product doesn't exist and the pricing is arbitrary.
